## Strings
* Single-and multiple-line literals
* Concatenation of adjacent literals
* Universal newlines
* Escape sequences
* Raw strings
* Use str constructor to convert other types
* Access individual characters with square bracket indexing
* Rich API
* String literals can contain unicode

## Bytes
* Sequence of bytes rather than codepoints
* Literals prefixed with lowercase "b"
* Use str.encode() and bytes.decode() for conversion

## List
* Mutable, heterogeneous sequences
* Literals delimited by square brackets
* Literal item separated by commas
* Access elements with square brackets
* Elements can be replaced by assigning to an index
* Grow lists with append()
* Use list constructor to create list from other sequences

## Dicts
* Associate keys with values
* Literals are delimited by curly braces
* Key-value pairs are separated by commas
* Keys are separated from values by colons

## For-loops
* Bind each item from an iterable one at a time to a name
